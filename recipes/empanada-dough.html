    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Making empanada dough from scratch allows 
        you to create perfectly flaky and tender empanadas.
         This dough is versatile and can be 
        used for both savory and sweet fillings.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cubed</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white vinegar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the chilled, cubed butter to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, cold water, and vinegar.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, stirring until the dough begins to come together.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead gently until smooth. Be careful not to overwork the dough.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into two balls, flatten each slightly, and wrap in plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before using.</li>
        <li>When ready to use, roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 1/8 inch thickness. Cut into circles using a round cutter (about 4-5 inches in diameter).</li>
        <li>Fill with your desired filling, fold, and crimp the edges to seal.</li>
    </ol>
